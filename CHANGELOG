* unit test: Add Slick XML unit test and fix a bug with JSSpec in Opera 9.64. [jddalton]

* Ensure feature test results return boolean values and make BUGGY_GEBCN test against a string and not a regexp. [jddalton]

* unit test: Add Slick unit tests. [jddalton]

* Add NW.Dom.setQSA(enabled) to allow testing NW.Dom.select() with and without using querySelectorAll(). [jddalton]

* Ensure element.style and element.className exist before attempting to access properties on them. [jddalton]

* Cleanup feature tests making them more consistent. [jddalton]

* Ensure getElementsByClassName(), getElementById(), getElementsByName(), and getElementsByTagName() exist on elements before calling them. [jddalton]

* Optimize prefiltering in client_api() avoding extra processing if `parts[1]` matches are undefined and allow filtering of selectors containing `:not` again. [jddalton]

* Refine `Optimize.tagName` to match more tagName selectors. [jddalton]

* Ensure native_api() returns an array of results for className selectors instead of nodeLists. [jddalton]

* Remove unnecessary grouping from `strSkipQuotes` and remove the `*` from the end of the `Optimize` regexps. [jddalton] 

* Avoid prefiltering in client_api() if the selector contains `:not` and move the `ID optimization LTR` block under the `ID optimization RTL` block. [jddalton]

* Move the client_api() `ID optimization RTL` block into the `reduce selection context` block to reduce tests if Optimize.id isn't matched in the selector. [jddalton]

* Ensure the element returned by gEBID actually has the id in the `reduce selection context` block of client_api(). [jddalton]

* Avoid name.toUpperCase() in getChildIndexesByTag() if possible. [jddalton]

* Remove toLowerCase() call in getAttribute(). [jddalton]

* Cleanup `switch` statements, reduce variable assignments in native_api(), and remove unused parts of ID/TAG optimizations in client_api(). [jddalton]

* Avoid unnecessarily converting the output of byClass() to an array. [jddalton]

* Remove the unused `view` variable and assign `lastContext` a default value of `context`. [jddalton]

* Add the native_api() method to handle simple selectors. [Diego Perini, jddalton]

* Remove the `r` argument from the compiled selectors and make match() support a callback argument. [jddalton]

* Make getChildIndexes() and getChildIndexesByTag() use do-while loops. [jddalton]

* Rename getChildrenIndex() and getChildrenIndexByTag() to getChildIndexes() and getChildIndexesByTag(). [jddalton]

* Rename caching vars `indexesByNodeType` and `indexesByNodeName` to `childIndexes` and `childIndexesByTag`. [jddalton]

* Simplify the `RE_BUGGY_QSAPI` regexp and allow FF to use Array.slice() in concatList(). [jddalton]

* Rename `reSimpleSelector` to `RE_SIMPLE_SELECTOR` and fork to optimize the regexp for IE. [jddalton]

* Remove the `data` argument from NW.Dom.select() because the same functionality can be achieved by the `callback` argument. [jddalton]

* Tweak the `reUnnormalized` regexp and make `RE_BUGGY_MUTATION` match `:disabled` and `:checked`. [jddalton]

* Make match() only process elements that have a `ownerDocument` property to avoid the document object. [jddalton]

* Expose NW.Dom.normalize() for testing purposes and ensure NW.Dom.compile() normalizes the selector. [jddalton]

* Make `reUnNormalized` more procise and ensure client_api() doesn't pave the `data` argument in Firefox. [jddalton]

* unit test: Update Prototype and jQuery unit tests. [jddalton]

* Optimize getChildren() by using a do-while loop instead of a while loop. [jddalton]

* Ensure byClass() coerces element.className to a string before attempting indexOf() because SVG elements have a non-string value for `className`. [jddalton]

* Ensure normalize() performs a quote safe approach if a selector contains `[` or `(`. [jddalton]

* Only normalize selectors that contain edge case whitespace like \t, \n , \r, \f and consecutive spaces. [jddalton]

* Reorganize the definition order of some of the feature test flags. [jddalton]

* Make compileSelector() handle attribute case sensitivity properly. [jddalton]

* Make INSENSITIVE_TABLE defined by feature test instead of docType sniff because many pages are sent with the wrong mime type causing XHTML to be processed as invalid HTML. [jddalton]

* Make client_api() cache empty results. [jddalton]

* Enable dom result caching by fixing how mutation event bugs are handled and rename `BUGGY_QSAPI` to `RE_BUGGY_QSAPI`. [jddalton]

* Optimize client_api() cached performance when passing a callback. [jddalton]

* Optimize client_api() compiled/dom caching. [jddalton]

* Optimize how select_qsa() processes the elements returned from querySelectorAll(). [jddalton]

* Avoid using querySelectorAll() if a compiled selector exists. [jddalton]

* Make the match() method utilize the compiled cache better. [jddalton]

* Ensure the match() method validates the selector. [jddalton]

* Normalize selectors to reduce selector parsing complexity and improve compiled/dom caching memory footprints. [jddalton]

* Avoid setting the `elements` var in client_api() until necessary. [jddalton]

* Make the cache pause timeout equal to the `minCacheRest`. [jddalton]

* Optimize client_api() by avoiding unnecessary property lookups and assignments. [jddalton]

* Optimize compileSelector() by reducing property lookups in the while loop. [jddalton]

* Make `concatList` and `concatCall` perform better in IE. [jddalton]

* Make the `Optimize` object properties names more consistent with the rest of NWMatcher's coding style. [jddalton]

* Simplify feature tests by recycling the div test element and temp vars. [jddalton]

* Use native String#trim if available. [jddalton]

* Reorganize source. [jddalton]
