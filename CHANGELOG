* Make INSENSITIVE_TABLE defined by feature test instead of docType sniff because many pages are sent with the wrong mime type causing XHTML to be processed as invalid HTML. [jddalton]

* Make client_api() cache empty results. [jddalton]

* Enable dom result caching by fixing how mutation event bugs are handled and rename `BUGGY_QSAPI` to `RE_BUGGY_QSAPI`. [jddalton]

* Optimize client_api() cached performance when passing a callback. [jddalton]

* Optimize client_api() compiled/dom caching. [jddalton]

* Optimize how select_qsa() processes the elements returned from querySelectorAll(). [jddalton]

* Avoid using querySelectorAll() if a compiled selector exists. [jddalton]

* Remove the unnecessary `from` argument from the match() method. [jddalton]

* Make the match() method utilize the compiled cache better. [jddalton]

* Ensure the match() method validates the selector. [jddalton]

* Normalize selectors to reduce selector parsing complexity and improve compiled/dom caching memory footprints. [jddalton]

* Avoid setting the `elements` var in client_api() until necessary. [jddalton]

* Make the cache pause timeout equal to the `minCacheRest`. [jddalton]

* Optimize client_api() by avoiding unnecessary property lookups and assignments. [jddalton]

* Optimize compileSelector() by reducing property lookups in the while loop. [jddalton]

* Make `concatList` and `concatCall` perform better in IE. [jddalton]

* Make the `Optimize` object properties names more consistent with the rest of NWMatcher's coding style. [jddalton]

* Simplify feature tests by recycling the div test element and temp vars. [jddalton]

* Use native String#trim if available. [jddalton]

* Reorganize source. [jddalton]
